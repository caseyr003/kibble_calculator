# Goal

Calculate the amount of dog food in pounds to order for the next month.

# Assumptions

- The order amount will be calculated in pounds by finding the minimum amount it will take to feed all the dogs subtracting the amount leftover from the previous month and adding 20% to that amount.

- The amount of small, medium, and large dog counts will be passed as a dictionary containing non-negative integers.

- The leftover dog food amount will passed as a non-negative float.

- If the leftover amount is equal to or greater than the needed amount, no extra dog food will be ordered.
